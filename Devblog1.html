            <p> Welcome to the Brickadia Deathrun Development Blog! In this first post, we'll discuss some of Deathrun modes in various games, and explore ways we could implement improvements and features into Brickadias Deathrun.</p>
            <p>Today we will be looking at these games: <b>Garry's Mod, Team Fortress 2, Roblox, Minecraft, and Blockland</b>. I am aware there are a bunch more, but if we went through all of them this post would be way too large for my brain to handle. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Garrys Mod</b></p>
            <p>Being first on my list isn't by chance. It's where Deathrun Began so respectfully they get to go first. G-Mod gave us many ways to create whatever we wanted. It was the place to look to if you ever wanted to play Deathrun. <br>Sadly this game is from 2004, and it shows.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Team Fortress 2</b></p>
            <p>This Deathrun has also been around for a while, and it looks like it too...</p>

            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Extra notes</b></p>
            <p>Before we go further I would like to address that I am not hating on any of these Deathruns. I loved these games when I was younger, I just want to show you why we need an upgrade.
		I also decided to look at a few other games including Halo, Portal 2, and Rust. It has come to my attention that most games other games that are like this are extremely outdated and are limited by their gaming engine.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Fortnite</b></p>
            <p>I'm going to keep this section short and sweet. Fornite Deathrun, while it is fun, doesn't fit with the normal Deathrun. It's more of an extremely long parkour course. This doesn't help us understand how to improve upon Deathrun. That being said, I'm putting Fornite Deathrun aside, and won't be mentioning it again.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Roblox</b></p>
            <p>Roblox is a big Deathrun I wanted to discuss. It was massively popular and was on the front page of Roblox for years. It currently has over 359.6 Million visits. It was an amazing experience for its time. But if you join now it's a complete ghost town compared to where it used to be. Only 131 active players currently. Yikes.<br>Let's take a closer look. why has it gone downhill?</p>

	    <p> The game looks pretty good itself, I don't see anything that would make it die out though the pictures & videos found online.</p>

            <p> Upon closer inspection. The project itself has been abandoned. It will no longer be receiving any updates. The Developers have decided to move to different projects. Nonetheless, I also gathered many pointers that I didn't like about their Deathrun, which I will be improving upon a few. I also ended up letting a Fellow developer of mine join for the first time to get his first impression and report back to me, these are a few of his notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I spawned in the middle of a round, took me a little while to realize what was going on. I was dead.</li>
                <li>Spectator mode is weird - You die, but It looks like you respawn, That was confusing at first.</li>
                <li>The Narrator they have is kinda spooky.</li>
                <li>The Physics Replication and lights, while they do exist, are not good at all. and fairly laggy</li>
                <li>As a Runner, I had no idea where the traps were located. I just guessed based on where the runners ahead of me went. The number of times I died without knowing why is sad</li>
                <li>As Death, I knew where the traps were but did not know what they did.</li>
                <li>There are a lot of features in the lobby that I had no clue how to use them. I get that learning is fun sometimes, but I shouldn't have to rely on others to know what to do.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think we now know enough of why it's been dwindling in numbers.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Minecraft</b></p>
            <p>Minecraft Deathrun is a very solid Deathrun I just wanted to touch on a point.<br> There is little room for creative traps, as we are very limited in what we can do. Most traps are all repeats of each other. This gets stale very fast.</p>

	    <p> If you look, you can easily see that the traps are very basic, and if you have ever played Minecraft Deathrun before, you know what the traps do, and you've seen them many times before.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Blockland</b></p>
            <p> Let's take a look at where a lot of us probably originated from. This game is from 2007. And it is abandoned nowadays. let's be honest. It doesn't look that good. It Runs horribly and needs Mods just to consider itself a functional game...<br>Its Deathrun is always fun to play, but without the addition of physics, moving parts, or making anything complicated without causing a ton of lag it falls short of providing the experience players expect from a Deathrun</p>
	    <p> I also want to say that I tried to take photos, but could not find any relevant ones because there were no servers up</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>I hope now It's obvious to you that Deathrun Needs an improvement, and it looks like Brickadia is going to fit best. Let's talk about that.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Graphics, and Performance</b></p>
	    <p> I feel like I don't need to say much to prove what would be improved here.
		Brickadia Runs on Unreal 5. It already has way better graphics, shadows, shaders, and basic performance. If you want to read up on how well Brickadia Performs I suggest reading the official Development blogs on the Brickadia Website.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Gameplay mechanics</b></p>
		<p><b>Trap Variety:</b> One of our key focuses is to introduce a diverse range of traps that challenge players' reflexes and strategic thinking. Each map will offer unique challenges and features.</p>
		<p><b>Progression and Leveling:</b> We're implementing a progression/Level system that rewards players with Points, Weapons, Titles, and other customization options as they achieve milestones and complete challenges</p>
		<p><b>Abilities and Special Rounds:</b> We introduce abilities and special rounds to add depth to the gameplay. Such as Double Deaths, a safe-point/Revive & the ability to obtain a gun!?<p>
		<p><b>Death Picks:</b> Instead of a random map, or a voting system. Whoever is Death gets to pick the map they want.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>General Improvements</b></p>
		<p><b>Improved Trap Visualization:</b> Runners will receive better visual cues about trap locations.
		<p><b>Detailed Trap Descriptions:</b> Deaths will have access to detailed descriptions of each trap, including their effects and length.</p>
		<p><b>Immersive Atmosphere:</b> Each map will have its own ambiance and mood.<p>
		<p><b>Enhanced Player Guidance:</b> Players will now spawn in the lobby before jumping into the game. This way they can learn what to do on the server instead of getting lost.</p>
		<p><b>Better Visuals:</b></p> Each map will have attention to detail. No more low-quality textures, or weird lights.</p>
		<p><b>Post-death experience:</b> Players will no longer be forced to sit after they die, along with being able to spectate others, they can play minigames in the lobby, buy stuff from the shops, and hangout!

		<p> Lets take a look at some pretty Brickadia Photos just to grab some attention</p>

            <p>Although we're at the beginning stages of this project, this blog post serves as a crucial glimpse into the future direction and potential of our work. Next time, we'll be talking about the actual development process of Deathrun in Brickadia. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
