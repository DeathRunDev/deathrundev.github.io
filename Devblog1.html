            <p> Welcome to the Brickadia Deathrun Development Blog! In this first post, we'll discuss some of Deathrun modes in various games, and explore ways we could implement improvements and features into Brickadias Deathrun.</p>
            <p>Today we will be looking at these games: <b>Garry's Mod, Team Fortress 2, Roblox, Minecraft, and Blockland</b>. I am aware there are a bunch more, but if we went through all of them this post would be way too large for my brain to handle. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Garrys Mod</b></p>
            <p>Being first on my list isn't by chance. This is one of the Deathruns I want to talk about the most. G-Mod gave us many ways to create whatever we wanted. It was the place to look to if you ever wanted to play Deathrun. It's where Deathrun Began. So props to them!<br>Sadly this game is from 2004, and it shows.</p>

            <p>This Deathrun has also been around for a while, and it looks like it too...</p>

            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Extra notes</b></p>
            <p>I decided to take a look at a few other games including Halo, Portal 2, and Rust, and It has come to my attention that most games other games that are like this are extremely outdated and are limited by their gaming engine.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Fornite</b></p>
            <p>I'm going to keep this section short and sweet. Fornite Deathrun, while it is fun, doesn't fit with the normal Deathrun. It's more of an extremely long parkour course. This doesn't help us understand how to improve upon Deathrun. That being said, I'm putting Fornite Deathrun aside, and won't be mentioning it again.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Roblox</b></p>

            <p>Roblox is the other big Deathrun I wanted to discuss. It was massively popular and was on the front page of Roblox for years. It currently has over 359.6 Million visits. It was an amazing experience for its time. But if you join now it's a complete ghost town compared to where it used to be. Only 131 active players currently. Yikes.<br>Let's take a closer look. why has it gone downhill?</p>
            <p> Upon closer inspection. The project itself has been abandoned. It will no longer be receiving any updates. The Developers have decided to move to different projects. Nonetheless, I also gathered many pointers that I didn't like about their Deathrun, which I will be improving upon a few. I also ended up letting a Fellow developer of mine join for the first time to get his first impression and report back to me, these are a few of his notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I spawned in the middle of a round, took me a little while to realize what was going on. I was dead.</li>
                <li>Spectator mode is weird - You die, but It looks like you respawn, That was confusing at first.</li>
                <li>The Narrator they have is kinda spooky.</li>
                <li>The Physics Replication and lights, while they do exist, are not good at all. and fairly laggy</li>
                <li>As a Runner, I had no idea where the traps were located. I just guessed based on where the runners ahead of me went. The number of times I died without knowing why is sad</li>
                <li>As Death, I knew where the traps were but did not know what they did.</li>
                <li>There are a lot of features in the lobby that I had no clue how to use them. I get that learning is fun sometimes, but I shouldn't have to rely on others to know what to do.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think we now know enough of why it's been dwindling in numbers.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Minecraft</b></p>
            <p>Minecraft Deathrun is a very solid Deathrun I just wanted to touch on a point.<br> There is little room for creative traps, as we are very limited in what we can do. Most traps are all repeats of each other. This gets stale very fast.</p>

	    <p> If you look, you can easily see that the traps are very basic, and if you have ever played Minecraft Deathrun before, you know what the traps do and youve seen them many times before.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Blockland</b></p>
            <p> Let's take a look at where a lot of us probably originated from. This game is from 2007. And it is abandoned nowadays. let's be honest. It doesn't look that good. It Runs horribly and needs Mods just to consider itself a functional game...<br>Its Deathrun is always fun to play, but without the addition of physics, moving parts, or making anything complicated without causing a ton of lag it falls short of providing the experience players expect from a Deathrun</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>I hope now It's obvious to you that Deathrun Needs an improvement, and it looks like Brickadia is going to fit best. Let's talk about that.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Graphics, and Performance</b></p>
	    <p> I feel like I don't need to say much to prove what would be improved here.
		Brickadia Runs on Unreal 5. It already has way better graphics, shadows, shaders, and basic performance. If you want to read up on how well Brickadia Performs I suggest reading the official Development blogs on the Brickadia Website.</p>

            <p>Although we're at the beginning stages of this project, this blog post serves as a crucial glimpse into the future direction and potential of our work. Next time, we'll be talking about the actual development process of Deathrun in Brickadia. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
