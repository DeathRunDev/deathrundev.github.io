    <p>What is this? A blog that's actually about a Deathrun? Only took us 3 tries! Despite the photo above, I'm not dead! Welcome to our third blog post! Today, I'm excited to showcase the first-ever Deathrun maps for our server.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Introduction</b></p>
   <p>Since our previous blog post was on everything surrounding Deathrun, I figured it would be time to talk about Deathrun. Specifically the maps</p>
    <br>
    <p> With Early Access releasing soon, It would make sense to release Deathrun with 3 functional maps, each one taking advantage of the new features that would be released, (Physics, Vehicles, and Behaviours)
	but before we work on the maps themselves, there were a few things we needed to get together</p>
    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Requirements</b></p>
	<p>I didn't want to have a bunch of non-epic maps so I put together a list of basic requirements we must all follow. This includes any Community maps that we might use in the future;
	So if anyone asks for a list of map requirements direct them to this Blog post</p>
<ul>
<li> Maps must have a theme, and be unique from all other maps. Try to stay away from generic themes (like snowy, or Tropical Islands), adding story elements can help with map creativity, without them you might find yourself running out of trap ideas.</li>
<li> Each map must have at least 1 unique feature. (think Cars from Sovereign Heights, or the changing traps in Jungle Escape)</li>
<li> All Traps must fit, and make sense with the map's overall theme.</li>
<li> Must be detailed; Minimalistic maps are ok, but nothing low effort.</li>
<li> Segment your map. Switch it up so it's not one long stretch of the same thing.</li>
<li> It must take between 55 (small) -  and 100 (large) seconds for the runners to reach the end of the course</li>
<li> Minimum of 11 traps Maximum of 18.</li>
<li> First few traps should be designed to take out multiple people at once, while traps towards the end of the course should target specific runners.</li>
<li> Must support a minimum of 15 Runners.  (Avoid narrow pathways and extremely tight spaces)</li>
<li> Generally avoid using teleporters for Runners path unless needed.</li>
<li> Reserve spaces for checkpoints</li>
<li> Deaths Pathway must be shorter than the Runner; And should not cross the Runners path</li>
<li> Death must have a clear view of the runners; Avoid putting a runner's path directly below the Deaths area.</li>
<li> Death must have access to their whole path at all times.</li>
<li> Traps need to be non-repetitive; (nothing twice in a row!) try to make a few unique ones that fit with the map's play style!</li>
<li> For large spaces between traps add fun features, like obstacles, or stunning visuals. Keep the players engaged at all times!</li>
<li> Traps & pathways must be obvious; No fake pathways, or anything that might confuse the players.</li>
<li> No profanity, or anything inappropriate.</li>
<li> Map Environment must look decent with the lobby, and work with the default water level of 101</li>
<li> Keep the Brick Count generally below 515k bricks</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been following Deathrun In other games you might recognize a few of these requirements. I did take a few directly from other games. If they work there, they will work here as well.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Requirements</b></p>
	<p>Through figuring out the Guidelines, I also decided to generalize the Different trap types based on how to proceed. It should help with trap diversity.</p>
	<b>Deathrun trap types</b>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hazard traps</strong> - (Spatial Awareness, Adaptation)</li>
        <li><strong>Team traps</strong> - (Teamwork, Communication, Coordination)</li>
        <li><strong>Mental traps</strong> - (Timing, Puzzles, Problem-solving)</li>
        <li><strong>Skill traps</strong> - (Parkour, Dodging, Blocking, Sprinting, Sneaking)</li>
        <li><strong>Sacrificial traps</strong> - (Sacrifice)</li>
        <li><strong>Chance traps</strong> - (Luck)</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Notes</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Traps can have split categories.</li>
        <li>Traps can transform types after activated (e.g., Skill turns into Hazard after pressed).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Map 1: Neon Highlights</b></p>
    <p>This map was pretty simple in concept, basic platforms </p>
    <p>• Player Engagement: Understanding what engages players in deathrun maps.</p>
    <p>• Technical Feasibility: Considering the game engine's capabilities and constraints.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Development of "Sovereign Heights"</b></p>
    <p>• Concept and Storyline: Pursuit through city rooftops, streets, and sewers.</p>
    <p>• Trap Design: Incorporating city-themed traps like helicopters, collapsing buildings, and street obstacles.</p>
    <p>• Visual Design: Creating an urban environment with detailed textures and realistic elements.</p>
    <p>• Gameplay Testing: Iterative testing to refine trap timings and player experience.</p>
    <br>

    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Development of "Neon Highlights"</b></p>
    <p>• Concept and Design: Neon-highlighted obstacle course with platforming challenges.</p>
    <p>• Artistic Direction: Choosing vibrant colors and futuristic aesthetics.</p>
    <p>• Obstacle Variety: Incorporating moving platforms, jump puzzles, and timed obstacles.</p>
    <p>• Player Interaction: Ensuring smooth gameplay flow and challenge balance.</p>
    <br>

    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Additional Design Insights</b></p>
    <p>• Player Feedback: Integrating community input during development.</p>
    <p>• Iterative Improvement: How we refined and polished the maps over time.</p>
    <p>• Collaborative Process: Highlighting the teamwork involved in map creation.</p>
    <p>• Technical Challenges: Overcoming hurdles in implementing specific traps or mechanics.</p>
    <br>

    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>In conclusion, "Sovereign Heights" and "Neon Highlights" represent our initial foray into map design for Brickadia Deathrun. These maps not only challenge players but also showcase our commitment to innovative and engaging level design.</p>
