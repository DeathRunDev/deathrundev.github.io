    <h2>Crafting the Surrounding Mountains: Majestic Backdrop</h2>
    <p>Our journey begins with the creation of the surrounding mountains that encircle the lobby. Using advanced terrain editing tools, we sculpted naturalistic contours and peaks to establish a breathtaking backdrop that sets the tone for the immersive experience of Brickadia Deathrun.</p>

    <h2>Establishing the Staff HQ: Operational Command Center</h2>
    <p>Next, we erected the Staff HQ—a central command center where our dedicated team orchestrates events, manages the server, and ensures a smooth and enjoyable gameplay experience for all participants. This behind-the-scenes hub is essential for maintaining the seamless operation of our game world.</p>

    <h2>Creating the Waterfall and Pond: Tranquil Oasis</h2>
    <p>The cascading waterfall and tranquil pond were meticulously designed to enhance the lobby's ambiance. Dynamic water effects and ambient sounds transport players into a serene natural landscape, providing a peaceful escape within the adrenaline-fueled world of Deathrun.</p>

    <h2>Constructing Pathways, Park, and Center Spawn Area: Navigational Hub</h2>
    <p>Interconnected pathways wind through the lobby, guiding players to various locales such as the park area and center spawn. The design emphasizes accessibility and exploration, encouraging players to discover hidden treasures and prepare for their Deathrun adventures.</p>

    <h2>Introducing the Deathrun Portal: Gateway to Adventure</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the lobby lies the Deathrun Portal—a beckoning gateway that transports players into heart-pounding gameplay. Step through to embark on thrilling challenges and adrenaline-fueled races against death itself.</p>

    <h2>Establishing the Ability Shop and Weapon Shop: Strategic Arsenal</h2>
