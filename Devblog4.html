	<p>Hey all! If you have read the previous development blogs, you probably wonder why they all have the same release date. The answer is that the website to write the blogs didn't exist yet!</p>
	<p>This blog is going to be shorter compared to the others. (I didn't take pictures of developing the website, Sorry!) </p>

    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Introduction</b></p>

    <p>It all started with wanting to keep a basic changelog to document updates and changes in Brickadia Deathrun. No seriously, I only planned on a document that I would share publicly.</p>
	<p>I asked if there was a free way to publicly host/share it without people downloading it directly to their computers/devices.</p>
	<p>If I had known I would get hyper-focused on HTML and design a whole website I wouldn't have done it. I ended up way beyond what I originally planned and created a website.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Website</b></p>
</p>I wanted this website to feel like it was part of Brickadia, so I matched the theme of the official website, I even made a custom logo! You can see it in the header. Its also now the icon of the Discord server</p>
  <p><b>ChangeLog</b>: This page is going to have the official releases of the Deathrun. It's where you can read up on those bug fixes that you want to hear about! </p>
		<div class="BlogImage" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            		<img src="./Assets/images/Blog3/Platforms.png" alt="Platforms" width="720" height="400">
        	</div>
<p><b>Support Page</b>: The Support page is going to be for The people, and the DR team. Here you can Report players and bugs. Apply for staff, and support the team! It also has our contact information, and who the Team members are.</p>
		<div class="BlogImage" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            		<img src="./Assets/images/Blog3/Platforms.png" alt="Platforms" width="720" height="400">
        	</div>
<p><b>Blogs (Main)</b>: This page is just a home page for the Blogs we write.</p>
		<div class="BlogImage" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            		<img src="./Assets/images/Blog3/Platforms.png" alt="Platforms" width="720" height="400">
        	</div>
<p><b>Blogs</b>: I wanted to talk more about the development process, and a changelog couldn't do that. So I stole Brickadia's Idea of development blogs. So expect blogs now and then, especially when updates are taking longer than expected</p>
		<div class="BlogImage" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            		<img src="./Assets/images/Blog3/Platforms.png" alt="Platforms" width="720" height="400">
        	</div>
<p><b>Home</b>: Since we have multiple pages we need this. This page brings together all the pages. Here you can see the 3 most recent Blogs and the 12 most recent updates.</p>
		<div class="BlogImage" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">

    <p style="font-size: 28px; color: #224C6B;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Told you this was going to be short! We have a lot of other stuff to talk about soon! Like Jungle Escape, DeathBot, and a whole slew of other things!</p>
 <p>This is the conclusion of the start of the blog series! We are officially caught up with where we are currently in Deathrun Development. These first 4 development blogs have been a pleasure to write, and I hope to see you soon!</p>
